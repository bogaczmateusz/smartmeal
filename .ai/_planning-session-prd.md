1. Authentication: A simple email and password system will be used. Deleting an account will permanently erase all associated user data, including recipes.
2. AI Recipe Generation: A third-party API (e.g., GPT-4, OpenRouter.ai) will be used. Users must enter a minimum of three ingredients. The prompt sent to the API will include instructions to encourage creative and varied results.
3. Ingredient Input: A tag-based input field will be used for entering ingredients for AI generation. For the MVP, it will not have autocomplete or other restrictions.
4. User Preferences: The only preference feature for the MVP will be a user-managed "ingredients to avoid" list. If a user tries to generate a recipe with an ingredient on this list, a non-blocking warning will appear, allowing them to proceed if they choose.
5. AI Recipe Interaction: AI-generated recipes cannot be edited before saving. The user has two options: "Save" or "Reject". Rejecting a recipe ends the interaction and the recipe is not stored.
6. Manual Recipe Creation: This feature will use structured repeater fields for "Ingredients" and "Preparation Steps," allowing for basic text formatting like bold. It will not be a single free-form text field.
7. Recipe Viewing: Saved recipes will be displayed in a card-based layout showing the title and ingredients. No images will be included in the MVP. The detailed view will present ingredients and steps clearly.
8. Platform & Design: The application will be web-only but must have a mobile-responsive design from the start.
9. Onboarding: There will be no formal tutorial. The UI will rely on minimalist cues and placeholder text to guide users.
10. Limits & Policies: For the MVP, there will be no usage limits on recipe generation and no Privacy Policy, as the application will not be publicly released initially.
11. Error Handling: If the AI service is unavailable, a clear, user-friendly message will be displayed.
12. Data Management: Recipe data will be stored in a structured format (e.g., JSON), but no import, export, or "copy to clipboard" features will be available in the MVP.

<matched_recommendations>
1. Authentication: Implement a simple email and password authentication system. When a user deletes their account, all their associated data should be permanently deleted.
2. AI Source: To accelerate MVP development, start by integrating a leading third-party API (e.g., GPT-4).
3. AI Prompting: In the prompt sent to the AI API, include instructions to encourage creativity and variation.
4. Input Requirements: Require a minimum of three ingredients to ensure the AI has enough input to generate a meaningful recipe.
5. Conflict Handling: A non-blocking warning is the best approach for handling conflicts between user input and their "ingredients to avoid" list, giving the user final control.
6. Manual Recipe Structure: Using repeater fields for ingredients and steps instead of a single free-form field ensures consistency.
7. Recipe Acceptance Metric: A recipe is considered accepted only when the user clicks the "Save Recipe" button.
8. Platform Design: A mobile-responsive web design should be required from day one.
9. Recipe List UI: A clean, card-based layout is suitable for displaying the list of saved recipes.
10. Onboarding Strategy: For a focused MVP, skipping a formal tutorial in favor of minimalist UI cues is an effective approach.
11. Error Handling: If the AI service is unavailable, display a clear and apologetic message to the user.

<prd_planning_summary>
This document summarizes the planning for the MVP, a web application designed to help users store, generate, and organize recipes.
a. Main Functional Requirements
1. User Account Management: Users can register using an email and password, and permanently delete their accounts and all associated data.
2. User Preferences: A profile page where users can manage a single list of "ingredients to avoid".
3. AI-Powered Recipe Generation: Users can input three or more ingredients to have a recipe generated by a third-party AI. They can then save (accept) or reject the result.
4. Manual Recipe Creation: Users can create their own recipes using a structured form with separate, repeatable fields for ingredients and preparation steps.
5. Recipe Viewing: Users can view their collection of saved recipes (both AI-generated and manually created) in a list.
b. Key User Stories and Usage Paths
1. Account Creation & Setup: A new user signs up for an account. They navigate to their profile to add several items to their "ingredients to avoid" list.
2. AI Recipe Generation: A user enters ingredients they have at home (e.g., "chicken", "rice", "broccoli") into the generation tool. The system returns a recipe. The user likes it and clicks "Save Recipe," adding it to their collection.
3. Recipe Rejection: A user enters ingredients and receives a recipe they don't like. They click "Reject," and the interaction ends.
4. Manual Entry: A user wants to save a family recipe. They use the manual creation form, adding each ingredient and preparation step one by one, and then save it to their collection.
5. Viewing Recipes: A user wants to decide what to cook. They navigate to their recipe list and browse through the titles of their previously saved recipes.
c. Important Success Criteria and Measurement
1. Primary Success Metric 1: 75% of AI-generated recipes are accepted by users. This will be measured by tracking the number of "Save Recipe" clicks versus the total number of generations initiated.
2. Primary Success Metric 2: 75% of all created recipes are generated using AI. This will be measured by comparing the count of AI-generated recipes to manually created recipes in the database.
3. No other KPIs will be tracked for the MVP.
