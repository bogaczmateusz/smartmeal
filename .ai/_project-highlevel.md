# Application – SmartMeal (MVP)

## Main Problem

Users often rely on browser bookmarks or saved links to external recipe sites, which frequently become unavailable or outdated. The application provides a centralized ecosystem to store, generate, and organize recipes — ensuring they’re always accessible and truly owned by the user. Powered by AI, it helps turn ideas and available ingredients into unique, personalized meals that match individual taste.

## Minimum Viable Feature Set

- AI-powered recipe generation based on entered ingredients and user preferences stored in the user profile.
- User can have multiple preferences to decide which one to use at the moment.
- User can accept or reject AI generated recipe.
- Manual recipe creation.
- Viewing, editing and deleting recipes.
- Basic user account system for saving recipes to the account and adding user preferences (ingredients that user wants to avoid).
- User profile page for storing personal preferences (ingredients to avoid).

## Out of Scope for MVP

- Importing recipes in multiple formats (PDF, DOCX, etc.).
- Recipe sharing between users.
- Integrations with external recipe platforms.
- Rating and comment system.
- Social features (e.g., following other users, sharing recipes, etc.).
- Recipe filtering functionality.
- Mobile applications (initially web-only).

## Success Criteria

- 75% of AI-generated recipes are accepted by users
- 75% of all created recipes are generated using AI
