# Application – SmartMeal (MVP)

## Main Problem

There is no simple, centralized place that allows users to store, generate, and organize recipes within a single ecosystem — independent of external websites. Saved web pages often become unavailable over time, which results in users losing access to their favorite recipes.

## Minimum Viable Feature Set

- AI-powered recipe generation based on entered ingredients and user preferences stored in the user profile.
- User can have multiple preferences to decide which one to use at the moment.
- User can accept or reject AI generated recipe.
- Manual recipe creation.
- Viewing, editing and deleting recipes.
- Basic user account system for saving recipes to the account and adding user preferences (ingredients that user wants to avoid).
- User profile page for storing personal preferences (ingredients to avoid).

## Out of Scope for MVP

- Importing recipes in multiple formats (PDF, DOCX, etc.).
- Recipe sharing between users.
- Integrations with external recipe platforms.
- Rating and comment system.
- Social features (e.g., following other users, sharing recipes, etc.).
- Recipe filtering functionality.
- Mobile applications (initially web-only).

## Success Criteria

- 75% of AI-generated recipes are accepted by users
- 75% of all created recipes are generated using AI
