## Getting Started Locally

To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js `v22.14.0`. We recommend using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) (Node Version Manager) to manage Node.js versions.
- `npm` package manager.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/bogaczmateusz/smartmeal.git
    cd smartmeal
    ```

2.  **Set up the correct Node.js version:**
    If you are using `nvm`, run the following command in the project root to switch to the correct Node.js version:

    ```sh
    nvm use
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root of the project by copying the example file:

    ```sh
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

    You will need to add your credentials for the following services:

    ```env
    # Supabase
    SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
    SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key

    # OpenRouter.ai
    OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_api_key
    ```

5.  **Run the development server:**
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```
    Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following commands:

- `npm run dev`: Runs the app in development mode.
- `npm run build`: Builds the app for production.
- `npm run preview`: Runs a local server to preview the production build.
- `npm run lint`: Lints the codebase using ESLint.
- `npm run lint:fix`: Lints the codebase and automatically fixes issues.
- `npm run format`: Formats code using Prettier.

## Project Scope

### In Scope (MVP)

- **User Accounts**: Register, login, and delete account.
- **User Profile**: Manage a list of "ingredients to avoid".
- **AI Recipe Generation**: Generate recipes from a minimum of three ingredients.
- **Manual Recipe Creation**: Manually add recipes with structured fields.
- **Recipe Management**: View, edit (manual only), and delete saved recipes.
- **UI**: Card-based layout for recipe lists and a mobile-responsive design.

### Out of Scope (MVP)

- Importing recipes (e.g., from URL, PDF).
- Social features (sharing, rating, commenting).
- Advanced recipe filtering or searching.
- Native mobile applications (iOS/Android).
- Recipe images.
- AI generation usage limits or privacy policy.
